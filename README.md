# daily-planner

in this app i created a daily schedule that a user can use to keep track of daily events. past time blocks appear grey, current time blocks appear red, and future time blocks appear green. to use, the user types an event in the chosen time block, and clicks the save button. events will persist upon reload.

## TODO:
- allow all time blocks to save inputs (currently only '9' time block works)
